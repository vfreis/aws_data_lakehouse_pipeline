# aws_data_lakehouse_pipeline
This project implements a cloud-native Lakehouse pipeline using AWS services following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze and Silver layers).  The pipeline ingests raw operational data from external APIs, stores immutable datasets in a Bronze layer, and processes validated and structured datasets into a Silver layer for analytics and AI workloads.
